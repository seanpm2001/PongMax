### Inspiration

#### What inspired this project

This project has 3 inspirations:

1. I could not find a good game of Pong on Ubuntu via the Ubuntu store, which was really surprising, due to how easy the game is to program.
2. I took interest from the [zenware/FizzBuzz](https://github.com/zenware/FizzBuzz/) GitHub repository, where someone writes a program called FizzBizz in every possible programming language.
3. Additionally, I took inspiration from [leachim6/hello-world](https://github.com/leachim6/hello-world) with Hello World being written in nearly 900 programming languages (it may have surpassed 900 after writing this)

##### Justification

Pong is one of the easiest games to program, and I thought it would be a fun community project to see it be programmed in every possible programming language.
